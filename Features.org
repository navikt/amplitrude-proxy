There's several green threads by tokio running different bits
of the program. They should fail at the same time. Experimentation
with panic! in one service confirms that they do. They also block at the same time
when tested with loop{}.
*** DONE /health

** TODO Grafana dashboard

** TODO log levels

** TODO Structure the code to allow for severeal upstreams :(
Currently we just branch willy-nilly. Perhaps the upstream choice
should get decided in request_filter and put into the context and
then we branch on that. (What are pingora modules? can we use that?)


** DONE Metrics
pingora has built in prometheus
